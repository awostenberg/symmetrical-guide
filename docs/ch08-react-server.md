ch08-react server

could not complete these - the expected error was not shown

- loc.433 ```import {useState} from 'react';```
- loc.456 ```'use client';``` 
 
why no error?
- maybe typescript
  - maybe busted. make it javascript, see if expected error. get different error ``import type`` not javascript.
- maybe react 14 (newer than 13 of Lim)
