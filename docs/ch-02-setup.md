Trying out Greg Lim's book tutorial "NextJS "

p12 . notice it does not include jest. how can I add? Usually I start up with next-jest... Reconsider or ask perplexity?

retry. 

`npx create-next-app@latest --example with-jest lim-book`

cd lim


and I want to use typescript.
Which `--exammple with-jest` does.

amd, against tutorial, I am "utilizing `src` directory".

I do the `npm run dev`
and see the very simple "app router" -- not the pretty nextJS page he paints. 
This is normal (tested before -- it is `with-jest` that is stripped down)

I hope it works without styling..

On to chapter 3: file structure, HomePage and Daisy UI.
